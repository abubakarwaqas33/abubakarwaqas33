📫 Projects

I developed varied projects such as E-Commerce apps, companies' portfolio websites, and point of sales using React and Node JS. Furthermore, I love to write clean and efficient code which a human can understand,  not just a computer. Moreover,  I built projects in the blockchain in which I developed contracts in solidity for NFT minting and crowdfunding.

🔭Current Project

Currently, I am working on blockchain projects, and I am doing integration of Metamask and Coinbase wallet in React JS web apps. 
Initially, I made contracts with other features in Solidity language and deployed them in the Ethereum network.

🌱 Learning 

I always hunger to learn and improve my skills due to reason every day try to improve myself on React, Node, and Blockchain as 
I believe nothing can be perfect so I always try to push myself up.
